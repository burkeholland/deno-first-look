Deno has a permissions API that will allow you to request certain access from your code as a library author.

In the "app.ts" file, define a `const` object which specifies the name of the "read" permission.

```typescript
const desc = { name: "read" } as const;
```

Pass the descriptor object to the `request` method on `Deno.permissions`. Because the permissions API is still unstable, it does not show up in intellisense under the "Deno" object.

```typescript
const desc = { name: "read" } as const;
const status = await Deno.permissions.request(desc);
```

The "status" variable will contain a "state" object after the user has either granted or denied permissions. If the permission is granted, the state will be "granted". If it is denied, then "denied".

Check the `state` object on the `status` constant to make sure permission has been granted. If so, list all the files in the current directory.

```typescript
const desc = { name: "read", path: "." } as const;
const status = await Deno.permissions.request(desc);

console.log(status);

if (status.state === "granted") {
  const results = await Deno.readDir(".");
  for await (const result of results) {
    console.log(result);
  }
} else {
  console.log("This program requires 'read' permissions to execute");
}
```

Run the program from the terminal with `deno run --unstable app.ts`.

You should see a prompt in the terminal asking you if you want to grant or deny permission to "read".

```bash
Check file:///home/burkeholland/dev/deno-first-look-exercises/app.ts
️⚠️  Deno requests read access. Grant? [g/d (g = grant, d = deny)]
```

Enter "g" to grant or "d" to deny and view the output.

> Note that if you run this program with the `--allow-read` flag, the permissions request will be ignored and the "status.state" value will be "granted".
