For instance, if the section we're on is \"Oak Templates\" in chapter 7, the branch you need to be on to follow along is \"7-oak-templates\". This convention is used for every section, although not every section has an exercise.</p>\n<p>Some sections build on each other. This becomes especially true when we get to the Oak section. If you get lost at any point, these sections contain a \"solutions\" folder that should have the working code.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-deno-dev-container\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-deno-dev-container\" aria-label=\"the deno dev container permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The Deno dev container</h2>\n<p>Deno Exercises also contain a \".devcontainer\" definition. What this does it preconfigures an environment where Deno is already installed and fully functional. You won't need to install anything, it will \"just work\".</p>\n<p>In order to use this Dev Container, you need to have the Remote-Containers extension for VS Code, as well as Docker Desktop installed. Note that if you are on Windows, it's highly recommended that you also have WSL2 enabled as the backing subsystem for Docker.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/intro","title":"How to use the exercises","order":"1B","section":"1 - Welcome","description":"Burke covers the agenda for the Deno First Look workshop, talks about himself a little bit more than you would probably like, explains how to submit issues with this course and then pontificates on whether or not Deno is something that has a future and if we should be investing valuable time into learning it."}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"edges":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"4E","path":"/dependencies/compatibility-with-node.md","title":"Compatibility With Node"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"4D","path":"/dependencies/best-practices.md","title":"Best Practices"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"4B","path":"/dependencies/local-dependencies.md","title":"Local dependencies"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"4C","path":"/dependencies/remote-dependencies.md","title":"Remote dependencies"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"4A","path":"/dependencies/think-like-a-browser.md","title":"Thinking like a browser"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"8B","path":"/oak/deploying","title":"Containerizing a Deno Application"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"8C","path":"/oak/deploying","title":"Deploying the Deno image"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"8B","path":"/oak/deploying","title":"Pushing the Deno image to a registry"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"3E","path":"/getting-to-know/arguments-and-flags","title":"CLI Tour"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"3F","path":"/getting-to-know/debugging","title":"Debugging"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"3D","path":"/getting-to-know/deno-object","title":"The Deno object"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"3C","path":"/getting-to-know/first-program","title":"Your first program"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"3A","path":"/getting-to-know/install","title":"Installing Deno"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"3B","path":"/getting-to-know/tooling","title":"Tooling"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"7A","path":"/oak/introducing-oak","title":"Introducing Oak"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"7C","path":"/oak/oak-router","title":"The Oak Router"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"7D","path":"/oak/oak-templates","title":"Templates"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"7B","path":"/oak/simple-oak","title":"A Simple Oak Server"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"7E","path":"/oak/simple-oak","title":"Servering Static Files"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"5D","path":"/permissions/determining-permissions","title":"Determining Permissions"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"5A","path":"/permissions/granting-permissions","title":"Granting Permissions"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"5C","path":"/permissions/permission-specificity","title":"Permission Specificity"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"5B","path":"/permissions/requesting-permissions","title":"Requesting Permissions"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"6B","path":"/webserver/reading-parameters","title":"Reading the query string"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"6A","path":"/webserver/simple","title":"Building a simple webserver"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"6C","path":"/webserver/static-files","title":"Serving up static files"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"1B","path":"/intro","title":"How to use the exercises"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"1A","path":"/intro","title":"Introduction"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"2C","path":"/what-is/dependency-hell","title":"Dependency Hell"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"2B","path":"/what-is/secure-by-default","title":"Secure By Default"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"2D","path":"/what-is/typescript-first","title":"TypeScript First"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"2A","path":"/what-is/why-oh-why","title":"Why"}}}]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["2959687377"]}
