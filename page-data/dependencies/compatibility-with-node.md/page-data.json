Are those packages compatible with Deno?</p>\n<p>Probably not.</p>\n<p>Deno <strong>does</strong> have a <a href=\"https://deno.land/std@0.67.0/node/README.md\">Node compabitibility module</a> in its standard library. In theory, at some point, you would be able to import this module and all Node code would \"just work\". However, as of the time of this writing, of the 38 built-in Node modules, only 8 are supported in the Deno compatibility module.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, if the npm package you are using does any system calls, it will be built with <code class=\"language-text\">node-gyp</code>. Deno simply doesn't support this. It's built with Rust and has an entirely different compiler for bindings. This means that a lot of Node modules are simply going to \"not work\". However - there's a lot of smart people out there and I'm sure that this is a problem that will be solved at some point.</p>\n<p>Also, the third party list for Deno is growing rapidly already. As I typed this section I checked for my least favorite <code class=\"language-text\">node-gyp</code> requiring package - which is Sass. There is already a Sass library that you can use with Deno.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/dependencies/compatibility-with-node.md","title":"Compatibility With Node","order":"4E","section":"Understanding Dependencies","description":"Burke dives into how Deno handles dependencies."}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"edges":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"1A","path":"/intro","title":"Introduction"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"4D","path":"/dependencies/best-practices.md","title":"Best Practices"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"4E","path":"/dependencies/compatibility-with-node.md","title":"Compatibility With Node"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"4B","path":"/dependencies/local-dependencies.md","title":"Local dependencies"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"4C","path":"/dependencies/remote-dependencies.md","title":"Remote dependencies"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"4A","path":"/dependencies/think-like-a-browser.md","title":"Thinking like a browser"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"8B","path":"/oak/deploying","title":"Bundling Deno Apps"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"8B","path":"/oak/deploying","title":"Containerizing a Deno Application"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"8B","path":"/oak/deploying","title":"Deploying a Deno Container"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"3E","path":"/getting-to-know/arguments-and-flags","title":"CLI Tour"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"3F","path":"/getting-to-know/debugging","title":"Debugging"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"3C","path":"/getting-to-know/deno-object","title":"The Deno object"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"3D","path":"/getting-to-know/first-program","title":"Your first program"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"3A","path":"/getting-to-know/install","title":"Installing Deno"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"3B","path":"/getting-to-know/tooling","title":"Tooling"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"7A","path":"/oak/introducing-oak","title":"Introducing Oak"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"7C","path":"/oak/oak-router","title":"The Oak Router"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"7C","path":"/oak/oak-templates","title":"Templates"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"7B","path":"/oak/simple-oak","title":"A Simple Oak Server"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"5D","path":"/permissions/determining-permissions","title":"Determining Permissions"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"5A","path":"/permissions/granting-permissions","title":"Granting Permissions"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"7E","path":"/oak/simple-oak","title":"Servering Static Files"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"5C","path":"/permissions/permission-specificity","title":"Permission Specificity"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"5B","path":"/permissions/requesting-permissions","title":"Requesting Permissions"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"6B","path":"/webserver/reading-parameters","title":"Reading the query string"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"6A","path":"/webserver/simple","title":"Building a simple webserver"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"6C","path":"/webserver/static-files","title":"Servering up static files"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"2C","path":"/what-is/dependency-hell","title":"Dependency Hell"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"2B","path":"/what-is/secure-by-default","title":"Secure By Default"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"2D","path":"/what-is/typescript-first","title":"TypeScript First"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"2A","path":"/what-is/why-oh-why","title":"Why"}}}]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["2959687377"]}
