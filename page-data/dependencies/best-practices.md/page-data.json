But it's sure not very pleasant to look at. You wouldn't really want a bunch of imported URL's just hanging out all over your code. That's no way to live your life.</p>\n<p>Deno recommends that you do all of your importing in a root file called <code class=\"language-text\">deps.ts</code> and export from that single file. That way all of your deps are in the same place, and all of the URL's are centralized to that one file. Later on in this workshop, we'll be building a full website with Deno and the <code class=\"language-text\">deps.ts</code> file for that project looks like this...</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"typescript\"><pre class=\"language-typescript\"><code class=\"language-typescript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  Application<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  Context<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  Router<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  send<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"https://deno.land/x/oak/mod.ts\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> Handlebars <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"https://deno.land/x/handlebars/mod.ts\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">export</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> Application<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> Context<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> Router<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> send<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> Handlebars <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Then our application code stays clean, and only references the <code class=\"language-text\">deps.ts</code> file.</p>\n<p>The common pushback I hear on this idea is \"I can't install the module if I'm on an airplane\". That is true. But you also can't install npm modules if you are on an airplane. Nothing changes here. npm package have to be downloaded. Deno modules have to be downloaded. Period. The only difference is that Deno is using the URL as the top level construct on which to identify the module, and npm downloads it and uses a specific location - node_modules.</p>\n<p>For those who still aren't convinced, let me leave you with this thought: Someone once suggested that we put HTML in JavaScript. I laughed at that person when I first heard that suggestion. Today, React is quite possibly the most popular JavaScript framework in the world, and we don't think twice about putting HTML in our JavaScript. In fact, it works quite well. In my humble opinion, having your markup and code in the same component file is BETTER than not. It's a better developer experience.</p>\n<p>I'm not saying that Deno is the React of JavaScript runtimes. I'm not saying that importing from URL's is going to ultimately be the better developer experience. But I am saying that sometimes we have to allow ourselves to examine possiblities that don't look so good on the surface.</p>\n<p>Give it a chance. I think you'll find that it's a relatively simple solution to the dependency problem.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/dependencies/best-practices.md","title":"Best Practices","order":"4D","section":"4 - Understanding Dependencies","description":"Burke dives into how Deno handles dependencies."}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"edges":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"4E","path":"/dependencies/compatibility-with-node.md","title":"Compatibility With Node"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"4D","path":"/dependencies/best-practices.md","title":"Best Practices"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"4B","path":"/dependencies/local-dependencies.md","title":"Local dependencies"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"4C","path":"/dependencies/remote-dependencies.md","title":"Remote dependencies"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"4A","path":"/dependencies/think-like-a-browser.md","title":"Thinking like a browser"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"8B","path":"/oak/deploying","title":"Containerizing a Deno Application"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"8C","path":"/oak/deploying","title":"Deploying the Deno image"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"8B","path":"/oak/deploying","title":"Pushing the Deno image to a registry"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"3E","path":"/getting-to-know/arguments-and-flags","title":"CLI Tour"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"3F","path":"/getting-to-know/debugging","title":"Debugging"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"3D","path":"/getting-to-know/deno-object","title":"The Deno object"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"3C","path":"/getting-to-know/first-program","title":"Your first program"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"3A","path":"/getting-to-know/install","title":"Installing Deno"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"3B","path":"/getting-to-know/tooling","title":"Tooling"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"7A","path":"/oak/introducing-oak","title":"Introducing Oak"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"7C","path":"/oak/oak-router","title":"The Oak Router"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"7D","path":"/oak/oak-templates","title":"Templates"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"7B","path":"/oak/simple-oak","title":"A Simple Oak Server"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"7E","path":"/oak/simple-oak","title":"Servering Static Files"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"5D","path":"/permissions/determining-permissions","title":"Determining Permissions"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"5A","path":"/permissions/granting-permissions","title":"Granting Permissions"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"5C","path":"/permissions/permission-specificity","title":"Permission Specificity"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"5B","path":"/permissions/requesting-permissions","title":"Requesting Permissions"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"6B","path":"/webserver/reading-parameters","title":"Reading the query string"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"6A","path":"/webserver/simple","title":"Building a simple webserver"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"6C","path":"/webserver/static-files","title":"Serving up static files"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"1B","path":"/intro","title":"How to use the exercises"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"1A","path":"/intro","title":"Introduction"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"2C","path":"/what-is/dependency-hell","title":"Dependency Hell"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"2B","path":"/what-is/secure-by-default","title":"Secure By Default"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"2D","path":"/what-is/typescript-first","title":"TypeScript First"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"2A","path":"/what-is/why-oh-why","title":"Why"}}}]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["2959687377"]}
