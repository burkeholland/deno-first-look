Complex systems, on the other hand, need a structured language with a type system.</p>\n<p>You may not agree with that, and that's ok. I don't know that I necessarily do myself. However, there are some key reasons to consider TypeScript as the preferred language for larger, more complex systems and applications.</p>\n<h2 id=\"structure-and-standardization\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#structure-and-standardization\" aria-label=\"structure and standardization permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Structure and standardization</h2>\n<p>One of the beatiful things about JavaScript is that there is no <em>right</em> way to do it. Everyone organizes their projects differently. Some people use classes and some don't. Some people use objects to store collections and some people use arrays. If you remember the book - The Lorax - JavaScript is like a thneed. It is whatever you need it to be.</p>\n<p>This is also one of the drawbacks. It makes it harder for organizations to standardize on JavaScript because they have to invent their own patterns.</p>\n<p>Strongly typed languages OO languages, by contrast, have a genuinely accepted set of patterns as laid out by books such as those laid out in the book \"Design Patterns\" by the notorious Gang of Four. By the way, one of those authors, Erich Gamma is the man behind VS Code. So these folks know what they are doing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"better-tooling\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#better-tooling\" aria-label=\"better tooling permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Better Tooling</h2>\n<p>VS Code provides some legit tooling for JavaScript. It's quite good and provides some things that VS Code simply cannot do with JavaScript.</p>\n<p>In the \"exercise\" project, install the Cosmos DB package from npm.

The following code won't work in Node, because it doesn't recognize the specifics of TypeScript...</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">const message: string <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Hello\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\nconsole.log<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>message<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note that Node WILL execute any file regardless of the extension. If the file contains valid JavaScript, it will work. You can try this out by putting some JavaScript in a file called index.smurf and then running it with node index.smurf</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In order to get TypeScript to work in Node, you have to convert it to JavaScript first. This is not hard to do in VS Code. All we need to do is initialize this project with a \"tsconfig\" file.</p>\n<p>From your terminal, run the following in the \"exercise\" folder to initialize the directory as a TypeScript project...</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">tsc --init</code></pre></div>\n<p>This creates a \"tsconfig\" file with a bunch of options. Like every option in the book. Most are commented out. It's not important here what these options are. We're just trying to see how TypeScript currently plays out in the real world so we can make a comparison with how it works in Deno.</p>\n<p>Now that \"index.ts\" file needs to be converted to JavaScript so we can run it with Node. To do that, Press <kbd>Cmd</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd> in VS Code.</p>\n<p>Notice that VS Code automatically detects that this is a TypeScript project and gives you the option to do a build, or a watch. Go ahead and select Build.</p>\n<p>The TypeScript file is \"transpiled\" to a .js file of the same name. And this file will run in Node. But now you have a problem. Instead of having one file, now you have two. Which, no big deal right? On a small scale no, but as the project grows, you'll have a fairly cluttered project directory, especially if you are also generating source maps. Because then you have 3 files for every one code file.</p>\n<p>We often mitigate this in VS Code with the setting \"files.exclude\" and then using globs to hide the \".js\" and \".js.map\" files...</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"files.exclude\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"**/*{.js,.js.map}\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>This has the side-effect of hiding the actual code files though. And furthermore, you need a watch process to make sure the underlying JavaScript is up to date. If you get out of date, you can spend a lot of time trying to figure out why something isn't working and it's because your watch process stopped running or some other error.</p>\n<p>When you deploy this app, the TypeScript needs to be built into JavaScript and then you don't need the TypeScript anymore and don't really want it on your production server. So what we often do is specify an output directy for the JavaScript and now we've got our project split into source and build directories.</p>\n<p>In the .tsconfig file, change the \"outDir\" to \"dist\".</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"outDir\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"dist\"</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>This works, except that anything that your project needs that isn't a TypeScript file ALSO needs to be copied into this dist directory. Like - say - an Express app. You'll need the templates and \"public\" folder from that to make sure you templates and static assets move with the project. At this point, you're probably into a build system like Gulp to try and automate this all. It can get tedious in a hurry.</p>\n<p>Now, I'm not suggesting that any of this is necessarily a bad thing. That might actually be the way things <em>should</em> be, but, that doesn't stop it from being a drag to set up and easy to mess up.</p>\n<p>In Deno, TypeScript is a first-class citizen. And as you'll see, when TypeScript is first-class none of this hackiness that comes from transpilation happens.
